# WW_SysTest

This is the Code Base for Team B's Window Washer robot for Carnegie Mellon University's Mechatronic Design(18-578) Capstone Course.

This was built to run on a STM32L152CDISCOVERY board and uses ST's HAL Library as well as the Arduino PID Library Platform Independent port by Github user tcleg.
